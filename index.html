            <h3 class="text-center text-primary font-bold text-lg text-main">What's Going On?</h3>
            <p class="p-4 mx-25 text-primary text-justify font-main">The article, <a class="text-accent text-center" target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-pills-louisiana-controlled-dangerous-substances-0984bfed536a5110997dd9c8264bf9e3">
            "Louisiana Governor Signs Bill Making Two Abortion Drugs Controlled Dangerous Substances"</a> from AP News, 
            addresses the recent signing of a Louisiana state bill that classifies mifepristone and misoprostol, both 
            commonly used to induce abortions, as Schedule IV drugs. This change would make accessing the drugs significantly 
            harder than it currently is, and will require doctors to have a special license to prescribe them. This bill also will 
            make possessing either drug a crime punishable with both jail time and fines. Those in favor of the bill argue 
            that raising the classification will help prevent abortions being done on uninformed women; however, many people in opposition argue 
            that this is an unnecessary change and that it will only make prescribing the proper medication for abortions even 
            more difficult than it already is. Furthermore, mifepristone and misoprostol both are used in other procedures, 
            and their classification changing would also make it much more challenging to complete those operations, such as 
            inducing labor and miscarriage treatment.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center text-primary font-bold text-xl text-main">Greater Meaning</h3>
            <p class="p-4 mx-25 text-primary text-justify font-main">A reclassification of abortion inducing drugs like these is dangerous and could lead to increasingly 
            stricter abortion control. This is a very important issue to me, because I strongly believe in people having as high a
            degree of bodily autonomy as possible, and preventing a pregnant person from recieving the care to allow them to get an abortion 
            is removing exactly that. The government should not be able to reach in a tell people what they can do to their own bodies.
            Furthermore, this isn't even a direct attack on a specific type of abortion, it targets all forms, even if it were to be life saving.
            Though it will still be possible to obtain a perscription for either drug, their reclassification will make it harder.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-center text-primary font-bold text-xl text-main">Important Questions</h3>
            <p class="p-4 mx-25 text-primary text-justify font-main"> There are many questions raised by this bill, but one of the things that comes
            to the forefront of my mind is what is the motivation of this legislation. This is not a direct abortion ban, it is specifically targetting
            the drugs used for such a proceedure. This sets off warning bells that maybe the legislation is trying to do something without explicitly
            stating it. It is highly likely that this was done so that there was an easier argument for pro-life conservatives to pass anti-abortion legislation
            without having to directly target abortion itself. Whenever there is legislation like this past, we have to ask what else it will affect.
            The negative affects on non-abortion proceedures from this bill is a very concerning. It adds more and more hoops to jump through,
            just to be able to treat a miscarriage or induce a birth. Every new law impacts many things at once, and there are definitely going to be side affects that weren't
            intended by the legislation's supporters from this bill.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-center text-primary font-bold text-xl text-main">What Does This Mean for the Future?</h3>
            <p class="p-4 mx-25 text-primary text-justify font-main">Whenever influencial legislation is passed, we must ask, "what will happen next?" Though it
            is impossible to say for sure, it can be reasoned that these restrictions will just be pushed forward. This is a concerning step in the
            direction of furthering restrictions on abortion care, and shows that people are willing to push to take people's bodily autonomy away.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-center text-primary font-bold text-xl text-main">Reaction</h3>
            <p class="p-4 mx-25 text-primary text-justify font-main">I had a very negative reaction to this bill, but the reactions will, sadly, most likely be 
            mixed. Abortion is a very divisive issue that people care about very strongly. I feel as though there is no place for the government to remove
            a person's bodily autonomy for any reason, and that this legislation is objectively harmful. It prioritizes the life of an unborn child over the
            life of a parent who knows better than the government about what decision is best for them. Legislation like this can doom children to a poor life 
            because of a parent that wasn't ready to have a child and that is wrong. An individual knows what is best for them better than the government
            so they should be making the decision whether to get an abortion or not.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-center text-primary font-bold text-xl text-main">What Needs Change</h3>
            <p class="p-4 mx-25 text-primary text-justify font-main">If I had the power to change things I would. I would do my best as a member of government to
            advocate for pro-choice legislation and try to prevent harmful legislation aiming to restrict abortion access. I would do everything in my power to make
            the people trying to recieve abortion care that can't feel protected and safe, because nobody deserves to feel abandoned. There is a lot of focus on the 
            unborn children in the discussion of abortion, but there should be more focus on the people left in terrible living situations because they were forced to
            have a child they knew they shouldn't have. I would do my best to switch this and bring to light the struggles of pregnent people in need of abortion care,
            who can't recive it.
